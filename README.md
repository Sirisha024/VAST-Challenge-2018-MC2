# VAST Challenge 2018 MC2

## Project Overview
This project is an analytical solution for the **VAST Challenge 2018 Mini-Challenge 2 (MC2)**, which focuses on analyzing and uncovering patterns in a large dataset related to a fictional city's residents. The challenge presents a complex dataset, simulating various activities over time, to assess data analysis, visualization, and interpretation skills.

## Objective
The primary goal is to identify suspicious patterns or unusual activities within the dataset. This involves:
- Detecting patterns in people’s movement and communication.
- Analyzing unusual behavior based on time, location, and communication data.
- Developing visualizations to effectively interpret and present insights.

## Dataset
The dataset simulates realistic data for the city’s residents, including:
- **GPS and Location Data**: Movement data of various individuals over a set time.
- **Communication Records**: Phone call and message logs that reveal communication patterns between individuals.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and organized raw data using **OpenRefine** to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis to uncover trends, movement clusters, and frequent contacts.
3. **Pattern Detection and Anomaly Analysis**: Identified patterns of interest, such as high-frequency communication between individuals or unusual movements.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations in **Tableau** to represent findings through heat maps, network diagrams, and timelines, enhancing data interpretation.

## Key Insights
The analysis yielded insights into resident behavior patterns, potentially suspicious activities, and abnormal interactions. Tableau visualizations highlighted significant relationships and event sequences, enabling a deeper understanding of complex data.

## Tools and Libraries
The project was implemented using:
- **OpenRefine** for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau** for comprehensive data visualization.


## Results
The project successfully identified notable patterns in communication and movement, helping address the challenge’s investigative questions. Visualizations provided clear insights into behavioral trends, supporting conclusions with detailed evidence.

## Conclusion
The VAST Challenge 2018 MC2 provided a rigorous test of analytical and visualization skills, demonstrating effective methods for handling large-scale data analysis challenges in a simulated urban context.
